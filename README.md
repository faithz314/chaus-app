# Chaus App Attempt

In a desperate attempt to prepare for a frontend interview, I've decided to continue my summer project of creating a Chaus App (in order to get practice with using React hooks). Not too sure how this will end up working out, but I hope I pass my interview!

## Setup Instructions

Clone this repository to edit and then run `npm install` within the chaus directory to gain all necessary dependencies.
